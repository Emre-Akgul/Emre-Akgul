# Emre Akgul

Hi! I'm Emre, a senior Computer Science student at Bilkent University, working on Deep Learning, AI, and optimization.

## ðŸš€ Projects
- **Robot Trajectory Planner**: Implemented SAC and HER algorithms with PyTorch to achieve a 100% success rate in finding trajectories for a robotic arm to reach target objects in a sparse reward environment.

- **UM Game Playing Strength of MCTS Variants**: Designed a predictive model using Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, reducing dimensionality from 813 to 26 features and achieving an RMSE of 0.42.

- **Chess AI**: A project focused on developing a chess engine by integrating various machine learning, AI, and optimization algorithms to enhance strategic gameplay. Still working on.

- **Fantasy Premier League Recommender System**: Utilized a Random Forest Regressor for player points prediction and a SCIP solver for team selection optimization, significantly surpassing average FPL manager points.

- **KMeans Clustering Algorithm Project**: Developed in Scala, this project showcases a KMeans clustering algorithm with a focus on performance optimization and algorithm efficiency through parallel execution.

- **BilConnect Second-Hand Sale Website**: Contributed to backend development using C# and ASP.NET, focusing on robust system design, data management with Azure SQL, and user authentication mechanisms.

- **15 Numbers Puzzle**: A Java-based project implementing a 15-number sliding puzzle that includes an automated solver to assist in arranging the tiles in sequential order.

- **Pathfinding and Sorting Algorithms Visualized**: A Python application using Pygame to visually demonstrate pathfinding and sorting algorithms, enhancing the learning experience.

- **Viral-Epidemic-Simulator**: A Java desktop application using LibGDX to simulate pandemic scenarios and measure the effectiveness of interventions like curfews and masks, incorporating Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for movement simulation.
